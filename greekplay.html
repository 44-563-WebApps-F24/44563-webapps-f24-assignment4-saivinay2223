    <h1>Sai Vinay Kumar Bikki presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
    <h2>Philoctetes by Sophocles</h2>
    <h3>Neoptolemus:</h3>
    <p>But what would you have me do?</p>
    <h3>Philoctetes:</h3>
    <p>Swear to me, child, by the mighty Zeus, lord of oaths.</p>
    <h3>Neoptolemus:</h3>
    <p>What is the oath you would have me swear?</p>
    <h3>Philoctetes:</h3>
    <p>Swear that you will convey me to my home, not to Troy.</p>
    <h3>Neoptolemus:</h3>
    <p>I swear it, by Zeus, as you ask.</p>
    <h3>Philoctetes:</h3>
    <p>And now, my son, give me your hand as a pledge.</p>
    <h3>Neoptolemus:</h3>
    <p>Here, take it. I shall not fail you.</p>
